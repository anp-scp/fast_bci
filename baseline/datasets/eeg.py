        Initializing an object of BCI2000 class

        Parameters
        ----------
        subjects : list
            List of subject numbers for which the data needs to be fetched. The numbers
            should be within 1-109. Here, each subject is treated as a task from the 
            perspective of MAML.
        label_mapping : dict
            The mapping of label and tasks. Each value in the dictionary should contain
            a list of tuples. First is the tuple of runs (1-14) and second is the tuple
            of desired annotation code (T0, T1, T2). Following example shows mapping of
            Task 1 with label 0 and Task 2 with label 1:

            ```python
            label_mapping = {
                0: [(3,7,11), ('T1', 'T2')],
                1: [(6,10,14), ('T1', 'T2')]
            }
            ```
        
        relative_epoch_start_t : float
            Start time of the epochs in seconds, relative to the time-locked event
        relative_epoch_end_t : float
            End time of the epochs in seconds, relative to the time-locked event
        crop_start : float
            Start time of selection in seconds
        crop_end : float
            End time of selection in seconds
        filter_setting : dict
            Parameters of Raw.filter() as key value pair (dict). Pass `None`, for
            no filtering. An example of `filter_setting` if given below:

            ```python
            filter_setting = {
            'l_freq': 7.0,
            'h_freq': 30.0,
            'fir_design': 'firwin',
            'skip_by_annotation': 'edge'
            }
            ```
        
        num_sample : int
            Number of samples per class
        min_time_points : int
            Minimum number of data points in time domain
